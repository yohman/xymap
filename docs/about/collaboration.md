# The Collaboration

This project is a unique partnership between **XYMAX**, a leader in real estate analytics, and **Professor Yoh Kawano** from Reitaku University. Together, we merge cutting-edge private-sector data analytics with academic research to create a holistic view of Tokyo's urban dynamics.

Our collaboration emphasizes the power of geospatial technologies and data visualization, delivering insights that are both practical and forward-looking.
